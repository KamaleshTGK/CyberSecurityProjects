# ⌨️ Keystroke Detector GUI (Java)

This project is a simple Java GUI application that **detects and logs keyboard events** (key presses and releases) in real-time using Swing and `KeyListener`.

---

## 📋 Features

- 💬 Graphical user interface with a text area
- ⌨️ Prints each **key pressed** and **key released** to the console
- 🪄 Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

## 💡 How It Works

- A `JTextArea` is placed inside a `JFrame`.
- The program listens for **key press** and **key release** events.
- When you type inside the text area, each keystroke is captured and printed in the console.
